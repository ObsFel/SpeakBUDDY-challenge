# SpeakBUDDY-challenge

Coding assignment for SpeakBUDDY by F.Z., following instructions at: https://github.com/apparray/speakbuddy_ios_exercise

## Notes

The project was created with minimum target iOS/iPadOS 16.4, on Xcode 14.3.1. Default implementation of a SwiftUI app.
Layout responsivness has been tested on devices smaller than the provided figma design (iPhone 8) and bigger (iPad).

Screenshots from the iPad build (left: portrait, right: landscape):

### Optional

The chart animation was developed natively in SwiftUI and can be seen by tapping the first choice in the splash screen selection, but given that a `.mov` video file was provided I thought it would be nice to also demonstrate an implementation with a video embed, I hope it's appreciated.
